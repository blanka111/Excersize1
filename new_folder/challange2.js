Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case numNeighbours is greater than 1.
Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when numNeighboursis 0 or any other value).
Test the code with different values of numNeighbours, including 1 and 0.
Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of numNeighbours. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why is this happening?
    Finally, convert numNeighbours to a number, and watch what happens now when you input 1.
Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this situation.

Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
If yours is the right country, log a strings like this 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('.

HOMEWORK
CHALLENGE #1
Blanka, Katka and Tina are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height)(mass in kg and height in meters).
Your task is to write some code to help them:
Store Blankas's, Tinaâ€™s and Katkas's mass and height in variables.
Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in three variables called BMIBlanka and BMIKatka and BMITina.
Log the value of BMIBlanka, BMITina and BMIKatka to the console.
BONUS: Create a boolean variable nameHasHigherBMI containing information about whether Blanka, Tina or Katka has a the highest BMI Log it to the console too
